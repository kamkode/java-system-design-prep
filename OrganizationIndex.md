## Navigation Guide

- For basic Java concepts, start with the **CoreJava** directory
- For advanced features introduced in Java 8+, refer to the **AdvancedJava** directory
- For coding practice, check the **CodingQuestions** directory
- For system design preparation, review the **SystemDesign** directory
- For Spring Framework concepts, check the **Spring** directory
- For interview preparation and practice, see the **MockInterviews** directory

## Study Strategy

1. **Start with fundamentals** in CoreJava
2. **Practice coding problems** in CodingQuestions
3. **Master advanced topics** in AdvancedJava
4. **Learn frameworks** through Spring and Microservices sections
5. **Prepare for design questions** using SystemDesign resources
6. **Practice with mock interviews** from the MockInterviews folder

Good luck with your Java Developer interview preparation!
