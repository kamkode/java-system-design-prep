### Original Question Collection
- ‚úÖ [Tricky-Interview-Questions](Tricky-Interview-Questions.md) - 40+ tricky output questions with explanations

## How to Use This Collection

Each file follows a consistent format with questions that include:
1. A code snippet that illustrates a tricky concept
2. The expected output or behavior
3. A detailed explanation of why the code behaves as it does
4. A follow-up question to deepen understanding

To prepare for interviews effectively:
1. Start with the core Java questions
2. Focus on one category at a time
3. Try to answer each question before looking at the explanation
4. Create your own variations of the questions to deepen understanding

## Roadmap to 500+ Questions

We've currently created **78+ questions** across five files:

| File | Questions | Status |
|------|-----------|--------|
| Tricky-Interview-Questions.md | 40+ | ‚úÖ Complete |
| Core-Java-Basics.md | 20 | ‚úÖ Complete |
| Multithreading-Questions.md | 10 | ‚úÖ Complete |
| Collections-Framework.md | 10 | ‚úÖ Complete |
| Basic-Stream-Operations.md | 8 | ‚úÖ Complete |

To reach 500+ questions, we'll continue building out the remaining topic files in this order of priority:

### Core Java Priorities (Java SE)
1. Advanced-Stream-Operations (30+ questions)
2. Thread-Synchronization (30+ questions)
3. OOP-Concepts (50+ questions)
4. Java-Memory-Model (25+ questions)
5. Generics-Deep-Dive (30+ questions)

### Full Stack Priorities (Java EE/Jakarta EE)
